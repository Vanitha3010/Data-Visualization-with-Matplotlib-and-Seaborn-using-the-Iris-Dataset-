# Data Visualization with Matplotlib and Seaborn using the Iris Dataset-

Introduction to Matplotlib and Seaborn:

Matplotlib is a comprehensive Python library used for creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations. It is widely employed for plotting data with great flexibility, offering control over plot appearance, including features like line plots, scatter plots, histograms, and bar charts.

Main Features of Matplotlib:

Supports high-quality 2D and 3D plots.
Offers extensive customization (colors, labels, grids, etc.).
Integrates well with libraries like NumPy and pandas.
Basic usage involves importing the pyplot module:
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

Common Plot Types in Matplotlib:

Line plots for continuous data.
Scatter plots for relationships between numerical variables.
Histograms to visualize data distribution.
Seaborn is a Python data visualization library built on top of Matplotlib. It simplifies the creation of complex statistical plots and works seamlessly with pandas.

Main Features of Seaborn:

Automatic handling of data frames and statistical plotting.
Built-in themes for aesthetic appeal.
Supports complex plots such as violin plots, pair plots, and heatmaps.
Basic usage involves importing the Seaborn library:
import seaborn as sns

Common Plot Types in Seaborn:

Pair plots for pairwise relationships.
Box plots and violin plots for data distribution.
Heatmaps for visualizing variable correlations.
Dataset Example: The Iris dataset contains 150 observations of iris flowers from three species (setosa, versicolor, and virginica), with features like sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width.
